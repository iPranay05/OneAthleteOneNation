# 🔧 **Quick Fix: Supabase Errors - SOLUTION**

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed:**

### ✅ **1. Column `profiles.sports` doesn't exist**
- **Fixed**: Updated coach service to use existing columns only
- **Removed**: References to non-existent `sports`, `disability`, `experience_level`, `last_sign_in_at`
- **Using**: Only `id`, `full_name`, `email`, `phone`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### ✅ **2. Table `coach_assignments` doesn't exist**
- **Fixed**: Disabled coach assignment functions temporarily
- **Added**: TODO comments for when table is created
- **Fallback**: Returns empty/null data instead of errors

## 🚀 **What Should Work Now:**

### ✅ **MyCoaches Screen:**
- **No More Errors**: Column and table errors resolved
- **Real Coach Detection**: Will show coaches from profiles table with `role = 'coach'`
- **Debug Info**: Shows actual coach data from Supabase
- **Clear Mock Data**: Button will work without errors

### ✅ **Expected Behavior:**
1. **If you have coaches** with `role = 'coach'` in profiles table:
   - Shows correct count: "X registered coaches available"
   - Request modal shows real coach names and emails
   - No more "Dr. Rajesh Kumar" mock data

2. **If no coaches** with `role = 'coach'`:
   - Shows "0 registered coaches available"
   - Request modal will be empty
   - No errors in console

## 📊 **To Test Your Setup:**

### **Step 1: Check Your Profiles Table**
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- See your table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check for coaches
SELECT id, full_name, email, role 
FROM profiles 
WHERE role = 'coach';
```

### **Step 2: Ensure Coach Exists**
Make sure you have at least one profile with:
```sql
-- Update a profile to be a coach
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'coach' 
WHERE email = 'your-coach-email@example.com';
```

### **Step 3: Test the App**
1. **Open MyCoaches screen**
2. **Click "Clear Mock Data & Refresh"**
3. **Check Debug Info** - should show real UUIDs, not mock IDs
4. **Click "Request New Coach"** - should show real coach data

## 🔍 **Console Logs to Look For:**

### **Success Logs:**
```
🔍 Loading coaches from Supabase...
📊 Raw coaches from Supabase: [{id: "uuid", name: "Real Name", ...}]
➕ Adding coach: {id: "uuid", name: "Real Name", email: "real@email.com"}
✅ Final coach profiles: ["uuid"]
